 Texans often hear sensationalized accounts about the splendors our capital brings. Austin, the live music capital of the world, might have a stronger draw than its lauded cultural scene. According to data retrieved from the U.S. Census Bureau, Austin has the largest percentage of households earning above $50,000 across Texas largest cities.</p>
<p>
Approximately, 58.60 percent of Austin households earn above the aforementioned earnings-margin. Data shows, the average Austin household earns $60,939 in earnings per year surpassing the national average of $55,322. The largest cluster of Austin residents above the aforementioned household-income margin, 17.80 percent, earn between $50,000 and $74,999.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, El Paso, the smallest of the cities considered in this analysis shows a substantially lower margin of residents earning above $50,000, 43.40 percent.  The average El Paso household earns a yearly average of $43,322. Only two Texan metropolitan areas, Austin and Fort Worth, have more than half of their residents earning above $50,000.
